        First version of my testing project have tested all data structures in algorithms library except
union data structures. I get a little bit trouble when write test cases for union data structures. This
Version only contains some naive but useful test skills. Later I will add more test strategies into the
data structures test case. Later, I will also test all sorting algorithms and other module in this library.
For now, I have six test files:
        1. stack.tstl: testing stack data structure.
        2. digraph.tstl: testing directed graph data structure.
        3. undigraph.tstl: testing undirected graph data structure.
        4. BST.tstl: testing Binary Search Tree data structure.
        5. queue.tstl: testing queue data structure.
        6. LinkedList.tstl: testing singly linked list data structure.

This version does not need any extra library. User only need to install algorithms library as I provide in 
proposal. To test each module, simply type "tstl testFileName --nocover" and run "python randomtester --nocover"
in command line.
