Project details

Part 1:  Proposal for what to test (20%)

- Identify a Python library (System Under Test) with multiple function calls
- Alternatively input is a complex string -- by some grammar

- Explain what you want to test about it (what correctness means)

- Briefly describe the system, where it can be found, etc.

Should be about 500 words.  Can be more, probably should not be less.

DUE DATE:  January 22, 2016

Part 2:  Initial version of testing system in TSTL (20%)

- Works

- Generates tests of some kind

- May not generate very GOOD tests

- May not test full intended functionality

- May not have many properties

This submission is primarily code, though any special instructions to
run the TSTL should be included (e.g., must some library be
downloaded/installed)

DUE DATE:  February 15, 2016

Part 3:  Bug/progress report (20%)

- Describe some bugs you found (in the System Under Test or your tester)

- Explain progress to date -- how has your test system improved from the start?

- Estimate your progress by end of term

- Discuss quality of the SUT

- Talk about code coverage, if possible

Should be ~500 words -- can be more!

DUE DATE:  March 1st, 2016

Part 4:  Final report on project (20%)

- What did you accomplish?

- Did you find bugs?

- How well does the tester work?

- What is wrong with TSTL?

- What is good about TSTL?

- Coverage summaries, any other important data on the test effort

Minimum of 1,000 words; figures, graphs etc. to improve understanding
welcome

- Imagine this is a final report to a project manager/report from
  consulting effort

Part 5:  Final version of TSTL code (20%)

- Your code, full documentation, test cases for discovered
  bugs/coverage/regression tests

DUE DATE:  March 14, 2016
